dyn-modeling-streams-2014
==========================

This repository contains the code and (part of) the paper for `Bovy
2014 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...795...95B>`__: Dynamical
modeling of tidal streams. Code to run the simulations used in the
paper is in the ``sim/`` directory together with code to calculate the
actions, frequencies, and angles of all simulation particles (this
takes quite a while...). The code to produce the figures in the paper
is all in the ``py/`` directory. The paper itself is located in the
``tex/`` directory, but note that this is not the final paper, as the
paper was finished in a separate repository. The included version does
include all of the commands necessary to produce the figures.

This code strongly depends on `galpy
<https://github.com/jobovy/galpy>`__.
